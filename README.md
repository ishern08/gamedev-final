How I Did This: 

Summary: Oh no! While you were on vacation, a rouge shark came into your town and released a bunch of tornados. 
They destroyed your furniture as well as a few of your friends. You need to help fix the messed up furniture then 
stop the shark from destroying anything else in your town.
